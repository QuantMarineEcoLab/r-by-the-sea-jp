```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#Import the possum data again
library(DAAG)
data("possum")
```

# Recall our work from the other days

```{r}
possum_large <- possum %>% 
  select(site,sex,totlngth) %>%
  filter(sex=='f') %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(mean_totlngth = mean(totlngth))
```

# ggplot: barplots with `geom_bar`

![](https://datasciencebook.ca/_main_files/figure-html/img-ggplot-1.png)

```{r}
ggplot(possum_large, aes(x=site, y = mean_totlngth)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Is there any improvements we could make to this graph? 

# To better view text

```{r}


#OR

```


# Labels, Colors, and Themes


```{r}

```

# ggplot: scatterplot with `geom_point`

```{r}

```
# With labels
